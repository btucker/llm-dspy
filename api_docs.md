# Authentication API
Our OAuth2 implementation supports the following flows:
- Authorization Code
- Client Credentials
- Refresh Token

Token refresh is handled automatically by the client library. When a token expires, the library will:
1. Check if a refresh token is available
2. If available, make a request to the token endpoint
3. Update the stored tokens with the new access token
4. Retry the original request

## Security Considerations
- All tokens are encrypted at rest
- HTTPS is required for all endpoints
- Rate limiting is enforced
- Failed attempts are logged and monitored
